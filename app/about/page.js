            Jireh Athletics was founded out of my passion for both sports and
            faith. As a former professional basketball player and lawyer, I have
            experienced the power of God being the great provider, and now seek
            to use this platform to share the message of Jesus Christ. Jireh
            Athletics is not just about athletics—it’s about inspiring others to
            live out their faith boldly and unapologetically.
